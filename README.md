Hi Andy/Mark, thanks again for your time on Monday and apologies for the brain freeze during the whiteboard!

Please see the HasWon() method in the program file which contains the algorithm to check for 4 in a row. This receives the x and y coordinates and a color and returns true for a win or false otherwise. With extra time I can see the diagonal checks could be refactored further to be made more DRY (albeit less readable!).

Sorry for the other superfluous code! I'm trying to teach my son some code and thought it would be fun for him to interact with it, hence the validating of moves and display...admittedly it is hard to stop once coding! :)
